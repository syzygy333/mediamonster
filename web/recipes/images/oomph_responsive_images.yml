# the type 'Site' means that the Drupal recipe will be listed in
# the installer.

  # An array of recipes to apply prior to applying this recipe. If any of these
  # recipes fail to be applied, this recipe will not be applied either.
  - oomph_admin
  # - another_recipe

install:
  # An array of modules or themes to install, if they are not already.

config:
  # A Drupal recipe can have a config directory. All configuration
  # is this directory will be imported after the modules have been
  # installed.

  # Additionally, the Drupal recipe can install configuration entities
  # provided by the modules it configures. This allows them to not have
  # to maintain or copy this configuration. Note the examples below are
  # fictitious.

  # Configuration actions may be defined. The structure here should be
  # configuration entity ID, action, and then action arguments. Below the user
  # role entity type with an ID of editor is being created if it does not exist
  # and then has permissions added. The permissions key will be mapped to the
  # \Drupal\user\Entity\Role::grantPermission() method.

content:
# A Drupal recipe can have a content directory. All content in this
